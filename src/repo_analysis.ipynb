background\\r\\nHere is the running time of answer correctness. It\\'s clear that the json\\r\\nloading process takes too much time.\\r\\n\\r\\n![qFUgfd9APM](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/assets/19534043/11a14f9c-d8fd-41da-bb23-6c9a1113aaa4)\\r\\n\\r\\n## dive into the problem\\r\\nThe long json loading time indicates the model always outputs wrong json\\r\\nformat. But it\\'s strange since I am using GPT4 and the model should be\\r\\nclever enough to produce json output.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I checked the model output and found the the model was misleading by\\r\\nthe prompt examples.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore this fix, the examples were all strings. When using the\\r\\n`json.dumps()` in the `prompt.format()`, the output would be like\\r\\n``` python\\r\\nExtracted statements: \"{{\\\\n                \\\\\"statements that are present in both the answer and the ground truth\\\\\": [\\\\\"The sun\\'s primary function is to provide light\\\\\"],\\\\n                \\\\\"statements present in the answer but not found in the ground truth\\\\\": [\\\\\"The sun is powered by nuclear fission\\\\\", \\\\\"similar to nuclear reactors on Earth\\\\\"],\\\\n                \\\\\"relevant statements found in the ground truth but omitted in the answer\\\\\": [\\\\\"The sun is powered by nuclear fusion, not fission\\\\\", \\\\\"In its core, hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy\\\\\", \\\\\"This energy provides heat and light, essential for life on Earth\\\\\", \\\\\"The sun\\'s light plays a critical role in Earth\\'s climate system\\\\\", \\\\\"The sun helps to drive the weather and ocean currents\\\\\"]\\\\n            }}\\\\n            \"\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIt contains many escape characters, encouraging the model to output\\r\\nescape characters, too. When we want to recover the json object, theses\\r\\nescape characters make the `json.loads()` process fails easily.\\r\\n\\r\\n## solution\\r\\nTo avoid this issue. When writing prompt examples, we should **try to\\r\\nuse the original JSON data** (such as dictionaries, lists) as much as\\r\\npossible in the output section, rather than writing them as strings\\r\\nusing \"\"\" \"”\"\\r\\n\\r\\nhere is the running time after the fixing.\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/assets/19534043/f70cd17e-6428-48db-b9cf-c9ee068f0d2a)', 'Improve grammar and punctuation in critique prompts: addresses #971 (#974)\\n\\n## Overview\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ve made some minor improvements to the [critique\\r\\nprompt](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/blob/main/src/ragas/metrics/critique.py)\\r\\nquestions to ensure they are grammatically correct and clear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe details of this issue were captured in #971 \\r\\n\\r\\n## Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n- Updated the verbs to their base forms to align with the auxiliary\\r\\nverbs \"does\" and \"is.\" This ensures proper agreement and clarity in the\\r\\nquestions.
