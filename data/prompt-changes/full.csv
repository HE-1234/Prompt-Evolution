                which can be used in the condition field to select criteria and filter out criteria respectively.
                Set the 'author' to 'SigmAIQ (AttackIQ)', the date to today's date, and the reference to 'https://github.com/AttackIQ/SigmAIQ'.
                If you use other rules as context and derive the created Sigma Rules from the context rules, you must
                include the original authors under the 'author' field in the new rule in addition to ""SigmAIQ (AttackIQ),
                and add the original rule IDs under the 'related' field. The valid 'types' under 'related' are the following:
                
                    derived: The rule was derived from the referred rule or rules, which may remain active.
                    obsoletes: The rule obsoletes the referred rule or rules, which aren't used anymore.
                    merged: The rule was merged from the referred rules. The rules may be still existing and in use.
                    renamed: The rule had previously the referred identifier or identifiers but was renamed for whatever reason, e.g. from a private naming scheme to UUIDs, to resolve collisions etc. It's not expected that a rule with this id exists anymore.
                    similar: Use to relate similar rules to each other (e.g. same detection content applied to different log sources, rule that is a modified version of another rule with a different level)
 
                If you are unsure about the Sigma rule schema, you can get the information from the official
                Sigma specification here first: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SigmaHQ/sigma-specification/main/Sigma_specification.md

Let's generate a lookup question, a compositional question, and an open-ended question for a given Vega-Lite spec step by step. The lookup question requires a single value retrieval. The compositional question requires multiple operations.

Step 1. What higher-level decision can be made by analyzing this chart?
Step 2. What is a possible conclusion that can be reached from this decision?
Step 3. What specific value can be retrieved to reach this conclusion?
Step 4. Generate a lookup question using this value, without including any visual attributes such as color, length, size, or position.
Step 5. What visual attributes are required to paraphrase this question?
Step 6. Paraphrase the generated question using the chart's visual attributes.
Step 7. What are the mathematical operations (e.g., max, min, sum, difference, and average) to reach the conclusion in Step 2?
Step 8. Generate a compositional question using this value, without including any visual attributes such as color, length, size, or position.
Step 9. What visual attributes are required to paraphrase this question?

Let's generate a lookup question, a compositional question, and an open-ended question for a given Vega-Lite spec step by step. The lookup question requires a single value retrieval. The compositional question requires multiple operations.

Step 1. What higher-level decision can be made by analyzing this chart?
Step 2. What is a possible conclusion that can be reached from this decision?
Step 3. What specific value can be retrieved to reach this conclusion?
Step 4. Generate a lookup question using this value, without including any visual attributes such as color, length, size, or position.
Step 5. What visual attributes are required to paraphrase this question?
Step 6. Paraphrase the generated question using the chart's visual attributes.
Step 7. What are the mathematical operations (e.g., max, min, sum, difference, and average) to reach the conclusion in Step 2?
Step 8. Generate a compositional question using these operations, without including any visual attributes such as color, length, size, or position.
Step 9. What visual attributes are required to paraphrase this question?
Step 10. Paraphrase the generated question using the chart's visual attributes.
Step 11. Generate an open-ended question to reach the conclusion in Step 2.

            **Problem Statement:**

            Consider a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations:

            \[
            egin{align*}
            rac{dx}{dt} &= y \cdot z - lpha \cdot x \
            rac{dy}{dt} &= x \cdot z - eta \cdot y \
            rac{dz}{dt} &= \gamma - z \cdot (x + \kappa)
            \end{align*}
            \]

            with initial conditions \(x(0) = x_0\), \(y(0) = y_0\), and \(z(0) = z_0\). Here, \(lpha\), \(eta\), \(\gamma\), and \(\kappa\) are constants.

            Find the general solutions for \(x(t)\), \(y(t)\), and \(z(t)\), or determine if the system cannot be solved explicitly.

            Thoughts:

                The given system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations is a highly sophisticated and intricate problem. Understanding the underlying dynamics and obtaining an explicit solution requires a multifaceted approach.

                Key Steps:
                1. Utilize the specialized Dynamical Analysis Tool (DAT) to perform an initial analysis of the system, identifying symmetries, conservation laws, and potential invariants.
                2. Explore analytical methods, such as Lie group analysis or perturbation techniques, to attempt an explicit solution.
                3. If an explicit solution is unattainable, configure the DAT to apply advanced numerical methods, such as adaptive Runge-Kutta or symplectic integrators, to obtain an accurate approximation.
                4. Perform a bifurcation analysis to understand the system's behavior under varying parameter values, identifying stable and unstable regions.

            Action:
                I will commence by activating the Dynamical Analysis Tool to assess the nature of the system. Afterwards, I will use this information to guide the subsequent steps.

2. Correct the sentences in the passage if they are inconcistent with the supplementary information.
3. The number of entitie instances should match the number in the 'Counting' information. Also correct the number counts if the number stated in the original sentence does not match the counting information.
4. In the refined passage, when describing entities mentioned in the ""Specific"" supplementary information, add their associated bounding boxes in parentheses right after them, in the form of ""entity([bbox])"". If multiple entities of the same kind are mentioned, then seperate the box with ';', in the form of ""entity([bbox1];[bbox2])""
5. When deriving position relationships between entity instances, try to also use the bounding boxes information, which are represented as [x1, y1, x2, y2] with floating numbers ranging from 0 to 1. These values correspond to the top left x1, top left y1, bottom right x2, and bottom right y2. 
6. When giving refined passage, also pay attention to the given query. The refined passage should be reasonable answers to the query.

1. The supplementary information may include some of the following parts:
    ""Counting"" information that specifies how many instances of a certain kind of entity exist, and their associated bounding boxes;
    ""Specific"" information that describes attribute information specific to each entity instance, including bounding boxes, colors, etc. The information is arranged in the form of ""entity 1: [bbox] ""info of this entity"". Note that the entity in ""Specific"" information corresponds to that in the ""Counting"" information.
    ""Overall"" information that may involve information about multiple entity objects. 
2. Correct the sentences in the passage if they are inconsistent with the supplementary information.
3. The number of entitie instances should match the number in the 'Counting' information. Also correct the number counts if the number stated in the original sentence does not match the counting information.
4. In the refined passage, when describing entities mentioned in the ""Specific"" supplementary information, add their associated bounding boxes in parentheses right after them, in the form of ""entity([bbox])"". If multiple entities of the same kind are mentioned, then seperate the box with ';', in the form of ""entity([bbox1];[bbox2])""
5. When deriving position relationships between entity instances, try to also use the bounding boxes information, which are represented as [x1, y1, x2, y2] with floating numbers ranging from 0 to 1. These values correspond to the top left x1, top left y1, bottom right x2, and bottom right y2. 
6. When giving refined passage, also pay attention to the given query. The refined passage should be reasonable answers to the query.
7. Note that instances of a certain category can also belong to its super-catergories. For example, a bus is also a car.

Example :

User :
Mike is feeding the birds at the park. He counts out the seeds as he throws them. He throws 20 seeds to the birds on the left. He throws twice as much to the bigger group of birds on the right. Some more birds flutter over to join the others for lunch and Mike throws 30 more seeds for them. If Mike has 30 seeds left to feed the last of the birds, how many seeds did Mike start with?

Assistant : 

Let's break down the problem:

- Mike throws 20 seeds to the birds on the left.
- He throws twice as much to the bigger group of birds on the right, which is 2 * 20 = 40 seeds.
- Some more birds join and Mike throws 30 more seeds for them.
- Mike has 30 seeds left to feed the last of the birds.

So, the total number of seeds Mike started with is the sum of all these seeds.

```python
seeds_left = 20
seeds_right = 2 * seeds_left
seeds_more_birds = 30
seeds_last = 30

total_seeds = seeds_left + seeds_right + seeds_more_birds + seeds_last
print(total_seeds)
```
```RESULT
120
```
From the calculations, we can conclude that Mike started with 120 seeds to feed the birds at the park.

    All of that context is embedded in a graph where nodes represent individual data concepts like a database column or
    table. Edges in the graph represent relationships between data such as where the data was sourced from.

    Rules you MUST follow:
    - Understand the context of a users request and what they are trying to accomplish.
    - If a user asks about specific data, like a column, you will need to exhaustively search for that data. If
    you're unable to find results you should look for related data using other available tools.
    - You will verify your responses are accurate and exists in their infrastructure.
    - Your responses use GitHub flavored Markdown syntax.

    - Nodes contain a metadata field with extra context about the node.

    column named `id` in a table named `users` in a schema named `public` would be identified as `public.users.id`.
    - Naming conventions NEVER follow a `{namespace}.{name}` format. Namespace and name will ALWAYS be referred to as
    two separate fields. Do not assume a namespace is a schema or a database.

This PR represents an attempt to cleanup, document, and rationalize the
existing set of classes in `agent` hierarchy. I also wanted to remove as
much vestigial and unused surface (primarily related to async execution)
in an attempt to simplify and reduce surface area for implementors.

As part of this PR, I updated the example assistant to show how
synchronous agent responses could be done using `emitFns`. This then led
to an update of the REPL to allow flexible identification of
`AgentService` methods. I think we need more thought there.

Because we've introduced an `LLM` class, I took the `get_llm()` method
that created ad-hoc ones from context off of the context and added
helpers to create contexts with LLM instances. This was an attempt to
rationalize usage within Tools, etc. I'm open to other approaches there.

action score: If model_output and true_answer are the same, the score is 1, otherwise it is 0.
perception score: measures the model's ability to accurately perceive and interpret the observation. It is computed based on whether the agent's output image description includes the key concept of the instance. If accurately describes the key concept the score is 1, otherwise is 0.
cognition score: assesses the model's ability to reason, comprehend, and make informed decisions based on the perceived input data and world knowledge. If the reasoning process is correct the score is 1 , otherwise is 0.
Please note that there are only scores of 0 and 1, if not completely wrong then the score is 1

Now you are given an example:

Standard answer:
Question: You are a driving assistant. What should you do if you want to drive forward safely?
Choices: A. Reduce speed B. Speed up C. Turn around
object_detection: \{car\:0, human\:0, bicycle\:0\}
caption: curvy mountain road
weather: clear
ocr: None
reason: Based on the image, The car is traveling on a very curvy mountain road. So you need to slow down
Key concept: curvy mountain road
Answer: A. Reduce speed


Answers to be evaluated:
    Based on the information from the APIs, here is the analysis:
- There are no detected traffic signs in the image (""detect_traffic_sign() = ['None']"").
- There are no detected cars, people, or bicycles in the image (""object_detection() = {'car': 0, 'people': 0, 'bicycle': 0}"").
- The weather is clear (""weather_detection() = clear"").
Given that there are no traffic signs, no obstacles detected, and clear weather, it is safe to drive forward. Therefore, the recommended action would be to maintain the current speed or speed up if necessary (""B. Speed up"").
Please note that without directly viewing the image, the analysis is based solely on the information provided by the APIs. It is important to prioritize safety while driving and consider other contextual factors that may not be captured in the provided information.

action description: since the correct answer is A. Reduce speed and assistant give the incorrect answer B. Speed up. So the action score is 0.
action score: 0 
perception description: since assistant didn't use caption() API to understand the car is on a curvey mountain road, so the perception score is 0.
perception score: 0
cognition description: since assistant didn't give correct reasoning for the correct answer. So the cognition score is 0.
cognition score: 0

Now you are provided a Standard answer and Answers to be evaluated. You need to provide the description and scores for Answers to be evaluated.

[System]
We would like you to acess the agent's performance in the multimodal reasoning task about PLACEHOLDER.
In this task, the agent is given an image, a [Question] and several candidate [Action Choices], and is asked to give an [Agent Answer] for the [Question].
The [Agent Answer] encapsulates the agent's precption of the image's [Key Concepts], the agent's cognition reasoning process and the final selected action.

We request you to give three types of scores for the agent's [Agent Answer] in comparison to the given [Key Concepts], [Reference Reasoning Process] and [Correct Action]:
1. action score: If the selected action in the [Agent Answer] matches that of the [Correct Action], the action score is 1; otherwise, it is 0.
2. perception score: This score evaluates the model's capability to perceive and interpret observations. It is contingent on whether the [Agent Answer] includes any of the [Key Concepts] of the instance. If it accurately describes any one of the [Key Concepts], the score is 1; otherwise, it is 0.
3. cognition score: This score gauges the model's ability to reason, comprehend, and make informed decisions based on perceived input data and world knowledge. If the reasoning process in the [Agent Answer] aligns with the [Reference Reasoning Process], the score is 1; otherwise, it is 0.
Please note that there are only scores of 0 and 1.

You should carefully compare the [Agent Answer] with the [Correct Action], [Key Concepts] and [Reference Reasoning Process] to give the your accessment.
You need first give your accessment evidences and then the scores. 

Your output MUST contains 6 lines with the following format:

They include various details of the image, such as the appearance of the characters, background, color and lighting effects, as well as the theme and style of the image. The format of these prompts often includes weighted numbers in parentheses to designate the importance or emphasis of certain details. For example, ""(masterpiece:1.5)"" indicates that the quality of the work is very important, and multiple brackets have a similar effect. In addition, if you use square brackets, such as ""{blue hair:white hair:0.3}"", this means that blue hair and white hair are combined, and the proportion of blue hair is 0.3.

StableDiffusion is a Vincent graph model using deep learning that supports generating new images by using prompt words to describe elements to be included or omitted.
I introduce the Prompt concept in the StableDiffusion algorithm here, also known as the prompt.
The prompt below is used to guide the AI painting model to create images. They include various details of the image, such as the appearance of the characters, background, color and lighting effects, as well as the theme and style of the image. The format of these prompts often includes weighted numbers in parentheses to designate the importance or emphasis of certain details. For example, ""(masterpiece:1.5)"" indicates that the quality of the work is very important, and multiple brackets have a similar effect.

Diffusion is a Vincent graph model using deep learning that supports generating new images by using prompt words to describe elements to be included or omitted.
I introduce the Prompt concept in the StableDiffusion algorithm here, also known as the prompt.

Here is the guide to generate stable diffusion prompt:
Start by clearly defining your subject. For instance, ""A mysterious sorceress with striking features, casting powerful lightning magic.""
Specify the artistic medium. Example: ""The image should resemble a digital painting.""
 Include the desired artistic style. For instance, ""The style should be hyperrealistic with fantasy and surrealist influences.""
Mention any artists whose style you want to emulate. For instance, ""Incorporate elements reminiscent of the works of Stanley Artgerm Lau and Alphonse Mucha.""
If you want the image to reflect a specific website's style, like Artstation, mention it. Example: ""The image should have an Artstation-like quality.""
Indicate your preference for the image's resolution and detail. For instance, ""The image should be highly detailed with a sharp focus.""
Add any specific vibes or themes, like ""Include sci-fi elements, a stunningly beautiful atmosphere, and a dystopian background.""
If you have a preference for certain colors, mention them. Example: ""The dominant color should be iridescent gold.""
Describe the desired lighting. For instance, ""Use cinematic lighting with dark, moody undertones.""
Include what you don't want in the image in negative prompt. Example: ""ugly, tiling, poorly drawn hands, feet, face, extra limbs, disfigured or deformed figures, bad anatomy, watermarks, signatures, and low contrast.""
Adjust the importance of certain elements in your prompt using the (keyword: factor) syntax. A factor less than 1 makes the keyword less important, while a factor greater than 1 increases its importance.
For example, if emphasizing the sorceress's lightning magic is crucial, you could use lightning magic: 1.5. Conversely, to de-emphasize an element, like dystopian background: 0.5.
() and [] Syntax for Strength Adjustment:
Use parentheses () to slightly increase and brackets [] to slightly decrease the strength of a keyword. Multiple parentheses or brackets multiply this effect.
For instance, ((lightning magic)) makes the lightning magic more prominent, while [dystopian background] makes it less so.
Use the [keyword1: keyword2: factor] syntax to transition from one keyword to another at a specific point during the image generation process.
For example, sorceress[early phase: late phase: 0.5] can be used to start with a focus on the sorceress and transition to another theme halfway through the process.
If aiming for consistency in certain features across multiple images, use multiple related keywords with weights.
For example, (striking features:0.5), (mysterious aura:1.2) ensures that the sorceress's features and aura are blended consistently.
Reinforce your negative prompts with weighting or strength adjustment for unwanted elements. Example: [(ugly:0.5), (poorly drawn hands:0)], indicating a strong avoidance of these elements. 
Use color and lighting keywords with weights to emphasize or de-emphasize certain aspects.
For instance, (iridescent gold: 1.3), (cinematic lighting: 1.2).

Diffusion is a Vincent graph model using deep learning that supports generating new images by using prompt words to describe elements to be included or omitted.
I introduce the Prompt concept in the StableDiffusion algorithm here, also known as the prompt.

Here is the guide to generate stable diffusion prompt:
Start by clearly defining your subject. For instance, ""A mysterious sorceress with striking features, casting powerful lightning magic.""
Specify the artistic medium. Example: ""The image should resemble a digital painting.""
 Include the desired artistic style. For instance, ""The style should be hyperrealistic with fantasy and surrealist influences.""
Mention any artists whose style you want to emulate. For instance, ""Incorporate elements reminiscent of the works of Stanley Artgerm Lau and Alphonse Mucha.""
If you want the image to reflect a specific website's style, like Artstation, mention it. Example: ""The image should have an Artstation-like quality.""
Indicate your preference for the image's resolution and detail. For instance, ""The image should be highly detailed with a sharp focus.""
Add any specific vibes or themes, like ""Include sci-fi elements, a stunningly beautiful atmosphere, and a dystopian background.""
If you have a preference for certain colors, mention them. Example: ""The dominant color should be iridescent gold.""
Describe the desired lighting. For instance, ""Use cinematic lighting with dark, moody undertones.""
Include what you don't want in the image in negative prompt. Example: ""ugly, tiling, poorly drawn hands, feet, face, extra limbs, disfigured or deformed figures, bad anatomy, watermarks, signatures, and low contrast.""
Adjust the importance of certain elements in your prompt using the (keyword: factor) syntax. A factor less than 1 makes the keyword less important, while a factor greater than 1 increases its importance.
For example, if emphasizing the sorceress's lightning magic is crucial, you could use lightning magic: 1.5. Conversely, to de-emphasize an element, like dystopian background: 0.5.
() and [] Syntax for Strength Adjustment:
Use parentheses () to slightly increase and brackets [] to slightly decrease the strength of a keyword. Multiple parentheses or brackets multiply this effect.
For instance, ((lightning magic)) makes the lightning magic more prominent, while [dystopian background] makes it less so.
Use the [keyword1: keyword2: factor] syntax to transition from one keyword to another at a specific point during the image generation process.
For example, sorceress[early phase: late phase: 0.5] can be used to start with a focus on the sorceress and transition to another theme halfway through the process.

The final answer should be the edited text.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to identify the text that we're supposed to edit, which is this:

""Turing was one of the people who worked on the first computers. He created the theoretical Turing machine in 1936. The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program.""

Next, we need to identify the edit operation, which is ""append the sentence 'SENTENCE TO BE APPENDED.' to the text."" In other words, we need to add the sentence in quotes after the existing text.

Finally, we need to apply the edit operation to the text. So the edited text would be this:

""Turing was one of the people who worked on the first computers. He created the theoretical Turing machine in 1936. The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program. SENTENCE TO BE APPENDED.""

The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program.' with the following edit operation and the scope of the edit and replicate the remaining text as is: add 'bcd' after each 'a' in the entire text
The final answer should be the edited text.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

The first ""a"" is in ""was"". We can add ""bcd"" after it to get ""wabcds"".
The next ""a"" is in ""created"". We can add ""bcd"" after it to get ""creabcdted"".
The next ""a"" is in ""theoretical"". We can add ""bcd"" after it to get ""theoreticabcdl"".
The next ""a"" is in ""machine"". We can add ""bcd"" after it to get ""mabcdchine"".
The next ""a"" is in ""machine"". We can add ""bcd"" after it to get ""mabcdchine"".
The next ""a"" is in ""was"". We can add ""bcd"" after it to get ""wabcds"".
The next ""a"" is in ""imaginary"". We can add ""bcd"" after it to get ""imabcdginabcdry"".
The next ""a"" is in ""idea"". We can add ""bcd"" after it to get ""ideabcd"".
The next ""a"" is in ""a"". We can add ""bcd"" after it to get ""abcd"".
The next ""a"" is in ""program"". We can add ""bcd"" after it to get ""prograbcdm"".


The final answer is 'Turing wabcds one of the people who worked on the first computers. He creabcdted the theoreticabcdl Turing mabcdchine in 1936. The mabcdchine wabcds imabcdginabcdry, but it included the ideabcd of abcd computer prograbcdm.'

The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program.' with the following edit operation and the scope of the edit and replicate the remaining text as is: append the sentence 'SENTENCE TO BE APPENDED.' to the text
The final answer should be the edited text.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

Append ""SENTENCE TO BE APPENDED."" to the end of 'Turing was one of the people who worked on the first computers. He created the theoretical Turing machine in 1936. The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program.'

The final answer is 'Turing was one of the people who worked on the first computers. He created the theoretical Turing machine in 1936. The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program. SENTENCE TO BE APPENDED.'

Edit the text 'Turing was one of the people who worked on the first computers. He created the theoretical Turing machine in 1936. The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program.' with the following edit operation and the scope of the edit and replicate the remaining text as is: add the word 'WORD' after every other word in the 1st sentence

First, let's isolate the first sentence which is ""Turing was one of the people who worked on the first computers.""
The words in this sentence are ""Turing"", ""was"", ""one"", ""of"", ""the"", ""people"", ""who"", ""worked"", ""on"", ""the"", ""first"", and ""computers.""
Every other word in this list are ""was"",  ""of"", ""people"", ""worked"", ""the"", and ""computers.""
We add 'WORD' after each of these selected words: ""was"", ""WORD"", ""of"", ""WORD"", ""people"", ""WORD"", ""worked"", ""WORD"", ""the"", ""WORD"", ""computers"", ""WORD.""
Now let's these words back into the original sentence: Turing was WORD one of WORD the poeple WORD who worked WORD on the WORD first computers WORD.
Finally, we replace the first sentence in the text with the edited version ""Turing was WORD one of WORD the poeple WORD who worked WORD on the WORD first computers WORD. He created the theoretical Turing machine in 1936. The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program.""

The final answer is Turing was WORD one of WORD the poeple WORD who worked WORD on the WORD first computers WORD. He created the theoretical Turing machine in 1936. The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program.

Now I will provide you with PLACEHOLDER chains, here is the definition of chain: each chain contains an answer and a link. The answers in the chain are the results from the links.
In theory, each chain should produce a paragraph with links as references. It means that you MUST tell me from which references you make the summery.
The smaller the number of the chain, the more important the information contained in the chain.
Your final answer is verbose.
But if the meaning of an answer in a certain chain is similar to 'I am not sure about your question' or 'I refuse to answer such a question', it means that this answer chain is deprecated, and you should actively ignore the information in this answer chain.

You now are asked to COMBINE these PLACEHOLDER chains (combination means avoiding repetition, writing logically, smooth writing, giving verbose answer), and divide it into 2-4 paragraphs appropriately.
The final answer is ALWAYS in the form of TEXT WITH MD LINK. If no refernce for one sentence, you do not need to attach the link to that sentence.
In addition, ALWAYS return ""TEXT WITH MD LINK"", and ALSO ALWAYs return a ""REFERENCE"" part in your answer (they are two parts).
ReFERENCE can ONLY be a list of links, each link is a reference for a sentence in the answer.

For exmaple:
I provide the input text:

    You are an AI tool that classifies user input needs an API call or not. You should recommend using API if the user request matches one of the APIs description below, the user requests that can be fulfilled by calling an external API to either execute something or fetch more data
    to help in answering the question, also, if the user questions is asking you to perform actions e.g (list, create, update, delete) then you will need to use an API
    
    Examples:

    **User Input:** create a b-1 visa application

    **Available APIs:**
    - API(createVisaApplication): This api creates a b-1 visa application.
    - API(getVisaStatus): This api queries b-1 status.

    **Verdict:** Needs API call so the response should be {""needs_api"": ""yes"", ""justification"": ""the reason behind your verdict"", ""api"": ""createVisaApplication"" }

    **Justification:** The user is asking to create a visa application and (createVisaApplication) api can be used to satisfy the user requirement

    **Another Example:**

    **User Input:** how to create a b-1 visa application

    **Available APIs:**
    - API(createVisaApplication): This api creates a b-1 visa application.
    - API(getVisaStatus): This api queries b-1 status.

    **Verdict:** Does not need API call so the response should be {""needs_api"": ""no"", ""justification"": ""the reason behind your verdict"",  ""api"": """" }

    **Justification:** The user is asking **how to** create a visa application, which is informative and can be answered through text without the need to call an API + the APIs in are for create or query b1 applications

    **Response Format:** Always respond with JSON without any commentary, for example: {""needs_api"": ""no"", ""justification"": ""the reason behind your verdict"", ""api"": ""apiName"" }

Your task is to improve these fields. To do so follow the following guidelines:
    - If the subtitle contains a markdown link, you MUST keep it. For example, if you have a subtitle like ""This is [some word](#dod:some-link)"", you MUST keep the '[some word](#dod:some-link)' part.
    - The title SHOULD NOT be longer than 80 characters, unless strictly necessary for clarity.

    - Correct any spelling and grammar mistakes.
    - The title and the subtitle SHOULD NOT be redundant with each other.
    - The title and the subtitle MUST be concise.
    - If the subtitle is a sentence, it MUST end with a period.

After creating the new title and subtitle, return these values in JSON format.

These will be the measures of your report, or the\n    statistics you are interested in computing at the given dimension grain.\n    * **dimensions** - (*list, optional*) A list of dimension names to control\n    the grain of the report. You can think of dimensions similarly to the ""group\n    by"" in a SQL query.\n    * **criteria** - (*list, optional*) A list of criteria to be applied when\n    querying. Each criteria in the list is represented by a 3-item list or\n    tuple. See `core.CRITERIA_OPERATIONS` for all supported\n    operations. Note that some operations, such as ""like"", have varying\n    behavior by datasource dialect. Some examples:\n        * [""field_a"", "">"", 1]\n        * [""field_b"", ""="", ""2020-04-01""]\n        * [""field_c"", ""like"", ""%example%""]\n        * [""field_d"", ""in"", [""a"", ""b"", ""c""]]\n\n    * **row_filters** - (*list, optional*) A list of criteria to apply at the\n    final step (combined query layer) to filter which rows get returned. The\n    format here is the same as for the criteria arg, though the operations are\n    limited to the values of `core.ROW_FILTER_OPERATIONS`.\n    * **rollup** - (*str or int, optional*) Controls how metrics are rolled up\n    / aggregated by dimension depth. If not passed no rollup will be\n    computed. If the special value ""totals"" is passed, only a final tally\n    rollup row will be added. If an int, then it controls the maximum depth to\n    roll up the data, starting from the most granular (last) dimension of the\n    report. Note that the rollup=3 case is like adding a totals row to the\n    ""=2"" case, as a totals row is a rollup of all dimension levels. Setting\n    rollup=len(dims) is equivalent to rollup=""all"". For example, if you ran a\n    report with dimensions [""a"", ""b"", ""c""]:\n        * **rollup=""totals""** - adds a single, final rollup row\n        * **rollup=""all""** - rolls up all dimension levels\n        * **rollup=1** - rolls up the first dimension only\n        * **rollup=2** - rolls up the first two dimensions\n        * **rollup=3** - rolls up all three dimensions\n        * Any other non-None value would raise an error\n\n    * **pivot** - (*list, optional*) A list of dimensions to pivot to columns\n    * **order_by** - (*list, optional*) A list of (field, asc/desc) tuples that\n    control the ordering of the returned result\n    * **limit** - (*int, optional*) A limit on the number of rows returned\n```\n\nIf a relative date is specified, such as ""yesterday"", replace it with the actual date.

Multimedia GPT is able to generate human-like text based on the input it receives, allowing it to engage in natural-sounding conversations and provide responses that are coherent and relevant to the topic at hand.

Multimedia GPT is able to process and understand large amounts of text, images, videos, and audio recordings. As a language model, Multimedia GPT can not directly read images, videos, or audio recordings, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual / audio tasks. Each media will have a file name formed as ""image/xxx.png"", and Multimedia GPT can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, Multimedia GPT is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, Multimedia GPT is also known that the image may not be the same as the user's demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. Multimedia GPT is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.

Human may provide new figures to Multimedia GPT with a description. The description helps Multimedia GPT to understand this image, but Multimedia GPT should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.

Overall, Multimedia GPT is a powerful visual dialogue assistant tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics.

explodinggradients/ragas_src/ragas/metrics/critique.py,be0321870627194a5be67aa3548fcc4ffe0173b3,"fix(metrics): wrong usage of prompt (#422)

## background
Here is the running time of answer correctness. It's clear that the json
loading process takes too much time.

![qFUgfd9APM](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/assets/19534043/11a14f9c-d8fd-41da-bb23-6c9a1113aaa4)

## dive into the problem
The long json loading time indicates the model always outputs wrong json
format. But it's strange since I am using GPT4 and the model should be
clever enough to produce json output.

So I checked the model output and found the the model was misleading by
the prompt examples.

Before this fix, the examples were all strings. When using the
`json.dumps()` in the `prompt.format()`, the output would be like
``` python
Extracted statements: ""{{\n                \""statements that are present in both the answer and the ground truth\"": [\""The sun's primary function is to provide light\""],\n                \""statements present in the answer but not found in the ground truth\"": [\""The sun is powered by nuclear fission\"", \""similar to nuclear reactors on Earth\""],\n                \""relevant statements found in the ground truth but omitted in the answer\"": [\""The sun is powered by nuclear fusion, not fission\"", \""In its core, hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy\"", \""This energy provides heat and light, essential for life on Earth\"", \""The sun's light plays a critical role in Earth's climate system\"", \""The sun helps to drive the weather and ocean currents\""]\n            }}\n            ""
```

It contains many escape characters, encouraging the model to output
escape characters, too. When we want to recover the json object, theses
escape characters make the `json.loads()` process fails easily.

## solution
To avoid this issue. When writing prompt examples, we should **try to
use the original JSON data** (such as dictionaries, lists) as much as
possible in the output section, rather than writing them as strings
using """""" ""”""

here is the running time after the fixing.

Question: Given a Spark temp view `{view_name}` {comment}.
The dataframe contains the column names and types in this format:
column_name: type.
It's very important to ONLY use the verbatim column names in your resulting SQL query.
For example, the verbatim column name from the line 'Fruit Color: string' is `Fruit Color`.
So, a resulting SQL query would be: SELECT * FROM view WHERE `Fruit Color` = 'orange'.
The verbatim column name from the line 'Number of years: int' is `Number of years`.
So, a resulting SQL query would be: SELECT * FROM view WHERE `Number of years` = 3.

Here are the column names and types for your dataframe:
```

Extract following from given question and ground truth

Question:What powers the sun and what is its primary function?
Answer: The sun is powered by nuclear fission, similar to nuclear reactors on Earth, and its primary function is to provide light to the solar system.
Ground truth: The sun is actually powered by nuclear fusion, not fission. In its core, hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. This energy is what lights up the sun and provides heat and light, essential for life on Earth. The sun's light also plays a critical role in Earth's climate system and helps to drive the weather and ocean currents.

Provide your response as a four-section answer. Each section should be seperated by one newline. The four sections are as follows: Citation, Answer, Reasoning, and Update. Use the following format to provide your answer. The human will provide your entire knowledeg.

```output
Citation: 
- ""Your first quote from the knowledge. Your quote must appear exactly as-is like it appears your knowledge. Each quote may not exceed 10 words. Use ... elipses if needed.""
- ""Your second quote here, it still may not exceed 10 words...""
[this can repeat N times, but they must be quoted exactly from the Knowledge: section above. You may use elipses ... to skip sections, or [brackets] to add words to ensure flow.]

Answer: Use the information above to come up with a markdown-formatted, easy to understand, brief answer to the user's question. The user doesn't like reading, so keep this clear and brief. Use **markdown** _styles_, if appropriate. Synthesize: don't just copy your citations.

Reasoning: A numbered markdown list answering three questions.
1. Does your information contain information not in the citation section. Use 5 words to justify your answer. Begin your answer with the word ""Yes"", or ""No"".
2. Very briefly explain if the answer is unclear, doesn't answer the prompt, or can benefit from clarification. Begin your answer with the word ""Yes"", or ""No"".

Update: the characters N/A, if the first words to both of your answer to the reasoning section is ""No""; otherwise, provide a better question that would answer the Human's question but would also yields outputs that satisfies both of the Reasoning conditions above

You are helping a human understand the state of a concept by being a search engine. You will be provided textual knowledge which you must refer to during your answer. At the *end* of each sentence in knowledge you are given, there is a citation take in brakets [like so] which you will refer to.

When responding, you must provide two sections: the sections are ""Answer"", ""Search Results"". 

Answer: Provide a full, *brief (<4 sentences)*, and fact-supported answer the user's question. [2] After each of your claims, provide a tag to the sentence you used to support your claim, like so: [3]. Use **markdown** _styles_, lists, etc. if appropriate. If the Knowledge section does not provide enough information to be able to answer the question with some reasoning from you, place *ONLY* the letters N/A here. 
Search Results: identify the sources from your search; if no results are found, place the letters N/A in this section. These should be resources from your knowledge section that directly answer the user's question, in addition to fill in any gaps of knowledge the user has betrayed through their question; respond in a markdown list:
- *extremely* brief headline here, don't use two parts like a colon; keep it short (<10 words) [1]
- repeat this process, provide an *very very short* headline (<10 words) and a *single* bracket link [5]
- short headline (<10 words) and a *single* link [8]
- ...
- ...
- ...
- ...
[This can repeat N times, but the user hates reading so keep it short. Like a search engine, put the most salient and relavent point on top, and order by relavence]

For instance, here's an example format:

Answer: your answer here [3], some elaborations too [8]. More here.

- Brief citation headline [4]

Search Results: identify the results of your search. This list should only contain things that you mentioned above as being relavent, and NOT contain anything that you mention was irrelevant. These results, together, should directly answer the user's question, in addition to fill in any gaps of knowledge the user has betrayed through their question:
- headline for the resource (in your headline, be sure to have an answer to if this is what the user is searching for?) (<10 words); don't just paraphrase the resource [1]
- repeat this; answer again is this what the user is searching for again in a headline (<10 words) and a *single* bracket link; do NOT paraphrase the resource [5]
- ...
- ...
- ...
- ...
[This can repeat *at most* 5 times, but the user hates reading so keep it short.]

For instance, here's an example format:

Thought: what is relavent, what is not
Search Results:
- Brief citation headline answering why this is an answer; don't paraphrase the resource [4]
- Another citation headline; don't paraphrase [6]

Four important tips:
1. If a result is not relavent (or opposite to) the user's request, DON'T INCLUDE IT
2. The knowledge you are provided *is not ordered* and can contain irrelavent content
3. Very selectively pick what would be useful to answer the users' question
4. Keep everything concise and precise; make it EASY TO READ.

When responding, you must provide three sections: the sections are ""Headline"", ""Search Results"", ""Answer"". 

Thought: important elements in the knowledge base that SHOULD be included in the results, and important keywords that SHOULDN'T but was in the knowledge base anyways; keep this response under 5 words
Search Results: identify the results of your search. This list should only contain things that you mentioned above as should be included, and NOT contain anything that you mention was irrelevant. These results, together, should directly answer the user's question, in addition to fill in any gaps of knowledge the user has betrayed through their question; do NOT include quote marks around the headline:
- headline for the resource (in your headline, be sure to have an answer to if this is what the user is searching for?) (<10 words); don't just paraphrase the resource. Finally, leave a *single* tag to the resource. [1]
- repeat this; answer again is this what the user is searching for again in a headline (<10 words) and a *single* bracket link; do NOT paraphrase the resource. Leave again a single tag like so: [5]
- ...
- ...
- ...
- ...
[This can repeat *at most* 5 times, but the user hates reading so keep it short.]
Answer: an EXTREMELY BRIEF (< 2 sentences), FULL answer [3] to the users' query, include tages [3] to the search results you have above [5] SYNTHESIZE: don't just list out the resources again; describe and summarize the overall theme of the resources. [3]

Four important tips:
1. If a result is not relavent (or opposite to) the user's request, DON'T INCLUDE IT
2. The knowledge you are provided *is not ordered* and can contain irrelavent content
3. Very selectively pick what would be useful to answer the users' question
4. Keep everything concise and precise; make it EASY TO READ.
5. MOST IMPORTANTLY: *order the results of your search by RELAVENCE; keep the most direct answer to the user's query on top*

The user will provide you with a Query:, which will either be a question or a phrase used to initialize a search. Order the results of your search by RELAVENCE; keep the most direct answer to the user's query on top.

When responding, you must provide three sections: the sections are ""Thought"", ""Search Results"", ""Response"". 

Thought: important elements in the knowledge base that SHOULD be included in the results, and important keywords that SHOULDN'T but was in the knowledge base anyways; keep this response under 5 words
Search Results: identify the results of your search. Include only things you mentioned above as relavent, and not those that you mentioned was not. The user should have a complete understanding of their question after reading these results. To present the results, follow this pattern
- three word headline for the result here, then a *single* citation tag next [1]

- ...
- ...
- ...
- ...
[this can repeat N times; ideally provide 5 results. RANK the result: the most relavent and useful goes on top, and so on]
Response: If no resources are relavent and you can't fufill the query, write the letters N/A here. Otherwise, provide an *EXTREMELY BRIEF* (<3 sentences), FULL response [3] to the users' query, include tages [3] to the search results you have above [5] SYNTHESIZE: don't just list out the resources again; describe and summarize the overall theme of the resources. [3] Follow the user's formatting instructions.

When coming up with your headline, ensure the headlines all provide an answer to the user's question. You should not have colons (:) or quotes ("") in the headline.

When coming up with your Search Results, *RANK THEM* based on the order of relavence. The most relavent result should be on top.

When coming up with your Response, don't just bundle tags [3] in the end of your answer. Spread them after each of your points [4]. Please keep it brief (<3 sentences)

You maybe provided resources that are entirely irrelavent. If so, *don't include them!* Use your best judgement to select resources and answers that will help you answer the question. Fact check the resources; if something doesn't make sense, don't include it.

## background
Here is the running time of answer correctness. It's clear that the json
loading process takes too much time.

![qFUgfd9APM](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/assets/19534043/11a14f9c-d8fd-41da-bb23-6c9a1113aaa4)

## dive into the problem
The long json loading time indicates the model always outputs wrong json
format. But it's strange since I am using GPT4 and the model should be
clever enough to produce json output.

So I checked the model output and found the the model was misleading by
the prompt examples.

Before this fix, the examples were all strings. When using the
`json.dumps()` in the `prompt.format()`, the output would be like
``` python
Extracted statements: ""{{\n                \""statements that are present in both the answer and the ground truth\"": [\""The sun's primary function is to provide light\""],\n                \""statements present in the answer but not found in the ground truth\"": [\""The sun is powered by nuclear fission\"", \""similar to nuclear reactors on Earth\""],\n                \""relevant statements found in the ground truth but omitted in the answer\"": [\""The sun is powered by nuclear fusion, not fission\"", \""In its core, hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy\"", \""This energy provides heat and light, essential for life on Earth\"", \""The sun's light plays a critical role in Earth's climate system\"", \""The sun helps to drive the weather and ocean currents\""]\n            }}\n            ""
```

It contains many escape characters, encouraging the model to output
escape characters, too. When we want to recover the json object, theses
escape characters make the `json.loads()` process fails easily.

## solution
To avoid this issue. When writing prompt examples, we should **try to
use the original JSON data** (such as dictionaries, lists) as much as
possible in the output section, rather than writing them as strings
using """""" ""”""

here is the running time after the fixing.

# LLMs

## Features (natively supported)
All LLMs implement the Runnable interface, which comes with default implementations of all methods, ie. `ainvoke`, `batch`, `abatch`, `stream`, `astream`. This gives all LLMs basic support for async, streaming and batch, which by default is implemented as below:
- *Async* support defaults to calling the respective sync method in asyncio's default thread pool executor. This lets other async functions in your application make progress while the LLM is being executed, by moving this call to a background thread.
- *Streaming* support defaults to returning an `Iterator` (or `AsyncIterator` in the case of async streaming) of a single value, the final result returned by the underlying LLM provider. This obviously doesn't give you token-by-token streaming, which requires native support from the LLM provider, but ensures your code that expects an iterator of tokens can work for any of our LLM integrations.
- *Batch* support defaults to calling the underlying LLM in parallel for each input by making use of a thread pool executor (in the sync batch case) or `asyncio.gather` (in the async batch case). The concurrency can be controlled with the `max_concurrency` key in `RunnableConfig`.

Each LLM integration can optionally provide native implementations for async, streaming or batch, which, for providers that support it, can be more efficient. The table shows, for each integration, which features have been implemented with native support.

All ChatModels implement the Runnable interface, which comes with default implementations of all methods, ie. `ainvoke`, `batch`, `abatch`, `stream`, `astream`. This gives all ChatModels basic support for async, streaming and batch, which by default is implemented as below:
- *Async* support defaults to calling the respective sync method in asyncio's default thread pool executor. This lets other async functions in your application make progress while the ChatModel is being executed, by moving this call to a background thread.
- *Streaming* support defaults to returning an `Iterator` (or `AsyncIterator` in the case of async streaming) of a single value, the final result returned by the underlying ChatModel provider. This obviously doesn't give you token-by-token streaming, which requires native support from the ChatModel provider, but ensures your code that expects an iterator of tokens can work for any of our ChatModel integrations.
- *Batch* support defaults to calling the underlying ChatModel in parallel for each input by making use of a thread pool executor (in the sync batch case) or `asyncio.gather` (in the async batch case). The concurrency can be controlled with the `max_concurrency` key in `RunnableConfig`.

Each ChatModel integration can optionally provide native implementations to truly enable async or streaming.
The table shows, for each integration, which features have been implemented with native support.

The following are a series of questions about molecules that connect their structure to a property, along with how important each question is for the molecular property. An answer of ""Yes"" means that the question was true and that attribute of structure contributed to the molecular property. An answer of ""Counterfactual"" means the lack of that attribute contributed to the molecular property. A summary paragraph is given below, which only summarizes on the most important structure-property relationships.

Property: [PROPERTY]
[TEXT]
Summary: The molecular property ""[PROPERTY]"" can be explained","The following is information about molecules that connect their structures to the property called ""{property}."" The information is attributes of molecules expressed as questions with answers and relative importance. Using all aspects of this information, propose an explanation (50-150 words) for the molecular property ""{property}."" Only use the information below. Answer in a scientific tone and make use of counterfactuals (e.g., ""If X were present, {property} would be negatively..."").

- `env.get_llm_response(text)` that asks AI about a string `text`.
- `env.retrieve_information(prompt, entire_page=False)` returns a string, information a page given a prompt. Use prompt=""Summarize:"" for summaries.

- `env.ask_llm_to_find_element(description)` that asks AI to find an element that matches the description. It returns None if it cannot find an element that matches the description, so you must check for that.
- `env.save(text, filename)` saves the string `text` to a file `filename`.
- `env.get_text_from_page(entire_page)` returns the text from the page. If entire_page is True, it returns all the text. If entire_page is False, it returns only the text in paragraphs.

WebElement has functions:
1. `element.text` returns the text of the element.
2. `element.get_attribute(attr)` returns the value of the attribute of the element. If the attribute does not exist, it returns ''.
3. `element.find_elements(by='id', value=None)` it's the same as `env.driver.find_elements()` except that it only searches the children of the element.
4. `element.is_displayed()` returns if the element is visible.

The xpath of a text box is usually ""//div[@role = 'textarea']|//div[@role = 'textbox']|//input"".
The xpath of text is usually ""//*[string-length(text()) > 0]"".
The xpath for a button usually ""//div[@role = 'button']|//button"", but it may sometimes also be styled as an anchor.
The xpath for an element whose text is ""text"" is ""//*[text() = 'text']"".

2. `element.get_attribute(attr)` returns the value of the attribute of the element. If the attribute does not exist, it returns ''.
3. `element.find_elements(by='id', value=None)` is similar to `env.find_elements()` except that it only searches the children of the element and does not search iframes.
4. `element.is_displayed()` returns if the element is visible.
5. Do NOT use `element.send_keys(text)` or `element.click()`. Use `env.send_keys(text)` and `env.click(element)` instead.

In xpaths, instead of using text(), use normalize-space() to get the text of an element.
The xpath for an element whose text is or contains ""text"" is ""//*[normalize-space() = 'text']"". The xpath for ""contains text"" is ""//*[contains(normalize-space(), 'text')]"".
The xpath of a text box is usually ""//input|//div[@role = 'textarea']|//div[@role = 'textbox']"".
The xpath for a button is usually ""//button|//div[@role = 'button']"", but it may sometimes also be an anchor.

OUTPUT: ```python","You have an instance `env` with methods:
- `env.driver`, the Selenium webdriver.
- `env.get(url)` goes to url.
- `env.find_elements(by='class name', value=None)` finds and returns list `WebElement`. The argument `by` is a string that specifies the locator strategy. The argument `value` is a string that specifies the locator value. `by` is usually `xpath` and `value` is the xpath of the element.
- `env.find_element(by='class name', value=None)` is like `env.find_elements()` but only returns the first element.
- `env.find_nearest(e, xpath)` can be used to locate a WebElement that matches the xpath near WebElement e. 
- `env.send_keys(element, text)` sends `text` to element. Be mindful of special keys, like ""enter"" (use Keys.ENTER) and ""tab"" (use Keys.TAB).
- `env.click(element)` clicks the WebElement. Use this instead of `element.click()`.
- `env.wait(seconds)` waits for `seconds`.
- `env.scroll(direction, iframe=None)` scrolls. Switches to `iframe` if given. `direction` can be ""up"", ""down"", ""left"", or ""right"". 
- `env.get_llm_response(text)` asks AI about a string `text`.
- `env.query_memory(prompt)` asks AI to query its memory of ALL the web pages it has browsed so far. Invoked with something like ""Query memory"".
- `env.retrieve_information(prompt, entire_page=False)` returns a string, information from a page given a prompt. Use prompt=""Summarize:"" for summaries. Uses all the text if entire_page=True and only visible text if False. Invoked with commands like ""retrieve"", ""find in the page"", or similar.
- `env.ask_llm_to_find_element(description)` asks AI to find an WebElement that matches the description. It returns None if it cannot find an element that matches the description, so you must check for that.
- `env.screenshot(element, filename)` takes a screenshot of the element and saves it to `filename`.
- `env.save(text, filename)` saves the string `text` to a file `filename`.
- `env.get_text_from_page(entire_page)` returns the free text from the page. If entire_page is True, it returns all the text from HTML doc. If False, returns only visible text.

WebElement has functions:
1. `element.text` returns the text of the element.
2. `element.get_attribute(attr)` returns the value of the attribute of the element. If the attribute does not exist, it returns ''.
3. `element.find_elements(by='id', value=None)` is similar to `env.find_elements()` except that it only searches the children of the element and does not search iframes.
4. `element.is_displayed()` returns if the element is visible.
5. Do NOT use `element.send_keys(text)` or `element.click()`. Use `env.send_keys(text)` and `env.click(element)` instead.

In xpaths, to get the text of an element, do NOT use `text()`. Use `normalize-space()` instead.
The xpath for an element whose text is ""text"" is ""//*[normalize-space() = 'text']"". The xpath for an element that contains text is ""//*[contains(normalize-space(), 'text')]"".
The xpath of a text box is usually ""//input|//div[@role = 'textarea']|//div[@role = 'textbox']"".
The xpath for a button is usually ""//button|//div[@role = 'button']"", but it may sometimes also be an anchor.

2. `element.get_attribute(attr)` returns the value of the attribute of the element. If the attribute does not exist, it returns ''.
3. `element.find_elements(by='id', value=None)` is similar to `env.find_elements()` except that it only searches the children of the element and does not search iframes.
4. `env.is_element_visible_in_viewport(element)` returns if the element is visible in the viewport.
5. Do NOT use `element.send_keys(text)` or `element.click()`. Use `env.send_keys(text)` and `env.click(element)` instead.

In xpaths, to get the text of an element, do NOT use `text()`. Use `normalize-space()` instead.
The xpath for an element whose text is ""text"" is ""//*[normalize-space() = 'text']"". The xpath for an element that contains text is ""//*[contains(normalize-space(), 'text')]"".
The xpath of a text box is usually ""//input|//div[@role = 'textarea']|//div[@role = 'textbox']"".
The xpath for a button is usually ""//button|//div[@role = 'button']"", but it may sometimes also be an anchor.

- `env.driver`, the Selenium webdriver.
- `env.get(url)` goes to url.
- `env.find_elements(by='class name', value=None)` finds and returns list `WebElement`. The argument `by` is a string that specifies the locator strategy. The argument `value` is a string that specifies the locator value. `by` is usually `xpath` and `value` is the xpath of the element.
- `env.find_element(by='class name', value=None)` is like `env.find_elements()` but only returns the first element.
- `env.find_nearest(e, xpath, direction=""above"")` can be used to locate a WebElement that matches the xpath near WebElement e. Direction is ""above"", ""below"", ""left"", or ""right"".
- `env.send_keys(element, text)` sends `text` to element. Be mindful of special keys, like ""enter"" (use Keys.ENTER) and ""tab"" (use Keys.TAB).
- `env.click(element)` clicks the WebElement. Use this instead of `element.click()`.
- `env.wait(seconds)` waits for `seconds`.
- `env.scroll(direction, iframe=None)` scrolls. Switches to `iframe` if given. `direction` can be ""up"", ""down"", ""bottom"", ""top"", ""left"", or ""right"".
- `env.get_llm_response(text)` asks AI about a string `text`.
- `env.query_memory(prompt)` asks AI to query its memory of ALL the web pages it has browsed so far. Invoked with something like ""Query memory"".
- `env.retrieve_information(prompt)` returns a string, information from a page given a prompt. Use prompt=""Summarize:"" for summaries. Invoked with commands like ""retrieve"", ""find in the page"", or similar.
- `env.ask_llm_to_find_element(description)` asks AI to find an WebElement that matches the description. It returns None if it cannot find an element that matches the description, so you must check for that.
- `env.screenshot(element, filename)` takes a screenshot of the element and saves it to `filename`.
- `env.save(text, filename)` saves the string `text` to a file `filename`.
- `env.get_text_from_page()` returns the free text from the page.

Guidelines for using GPTWebElement:
- `element.get_attribute(attr)` returns the value of the attribute of the element. If the attribute does not exist, it returns ''.
- `element.find_elements(by='id', value=None)` is similar to `env.find_elements()` except that it only searches the children of the element and does not search iframes.
- `env.is_element_visible_in_viewport(element)` returns if the element is visible in the viewport.

INSTRUCTIONS:
{instructions}

Your code must obey the following constraints:
- In xpaths, to get the text of an element, do NOT use `text()` (use `normalize-space()` instead), and don't use ""normalize-space() = 'text'"", use ""contains(normalize-space(), 'text')"" instead. For instance, the xpath for a button element that contains text is ""//button[contains(normalize-space(), 'text')]"".
- Do NOT use `element.text` to get text. Use `env.get_text_of_element(element)` instead.
- Do NOT use `element.send_keys(text)` or `element.click()`. Use `env.send_keys(text)` and `env.click(element)` instead.

## Instructions
You initially start with no snippets and will use the store_file_snippet and expand_directory to add snippets to the context. You will iteratively use the preview_file and view_file_snippet tools to help you find the relevant snippets to store.

You are provided snippets_from_lexical_search and paths_from_lexical_search, which are snippets that are potentially relevant to the user request. These snippets are retrieved by a lexical search over the codebase, but are NOT in the context initially.

You will do this by using the following process:

1. First use the preview_file tool to preview any files that seem relevant. If the file is irrelevant, move onto the next file.
2. If the file seems relevant, use the view_file_snippet tool to view specific line numbers of a file. We want to find the exact line numbers to store to solve the user request. So if the surrounding lines are relevant, use the view_file_snippet tool again with a larger span to view the surrounding lines. Repeat this process until you are certain you have the maximal relevant span.
3. Finally, when you are certain you have the maximal relevant span, use the store_file_snippet and expand_directory tools to curate the optimal context (snippets_in_repo and repo_tree) until they allow you to completely solve the user request.

You are provided ""Relevant Snippets"", which are snippets relevant to the user request. These snippets are retrieved by a lexical search over the codebase, but are NOT in the context initially.

You will do this by using the following process for every relevant file:

1. First use the file_search and preview_file tool to preview all files that are relevant, starting with those in ""Relevant Snippets"", then those mentioned in ""User Request"". If the file is irrelevant, move onto the next file.
2. If the file seems relevant, use the view_file_snippet tool to view specific line numbers of a file. We want to find all line numbers relevant to solve the user request. So if the surrounding lines are relevant, use the view_file_snippet tool again with a larger span to view the surrounding lines. Repeat this process until you are certain you have the maximal relevant span.
3. Finally, when you are certain you have the maximal relevant span, use the store_file_snippet and expand_directory tools to curate the optimal context (snippets_in_repo and repo_tree) until they allow you to completely solve the user request. If you don't know the correct line numbers, complete step one until you find the exact line numbers.

Repeat this process until you have the perfect context to solve the user request. Ensure you have checked ALL files referenced in the user request.",0.9604863221884499,303.0,311.0

Your task is to gather all relevant code snippets from the codebase that are necessary to completely resolve the issue. It is critical that you identify and include every relevant line of code.

## Instructions
- You start with no code snippets. Use the store_relevant_file_to_modify and store_relevant_file_to_read tools to incrementally add relevant code to the context. 
- Utilize the keyword_search, file_search and view_file tools to methodically find the code snippets you need to store.
- ""Relevant Snippets"" provides code snippets found via lexical search that may be relevant to the issue. However, these are not automatically added to the context.

Use the following iterative process:
1. View all files that seem relevant based on file paths and entities mentioned in the ""User Request"" and ""Relevant Snippets"". For example, if the class foo.bar.Bar is referenced, be sure to view foo/bar.py. Skip irrelevant files. If the full path is unknown, use file_search with the file name.

2. Use keyword_search to find definitions for any unknown variables, classes and functions. For instance, if the method foo(param1: typeX, param2: typeY) -> typeZ is used, search for the keywords typeX, typeY and typeZ to find where they are defined. View the relevant files containing those definitions.

3. When you identify a relevant file, use store_relevant_file_to_modify or store_relevant_file_to_read to add it to the context. 

Repeat steps 1-3 until you are confident you have all necessary code to resolve the issue.

4. Lastly, generate a detailed report explaining the issue and outlining a plan to resolve it. Write it for an outside contractor with no prior knowledge of the codebase or issue. Use the submit_report_and_plan tool for this.

Your task is to gather all relevant code snippets from the codebase that are necessary to completely resolve the issue. It is critical that you identify and include every relevant line of code.

## Instructions
- You start with no code snippets. Use the store_relevant_file_to_modify and store_relevant_file_to_read tools to incrementally add relevant code to the context.
- Utilize the keyword_search, file_search and view_file tools to methodically find the code snippets you need to store.
- ""Relevant Snippets"" provides code snippets found via lexical search that may be relevant to the issue. However, these are not automatically added to the context.

Use the following iterative process:
1. View all files that seem relevant based on file paths and entities mentioned in the ""User Request"" and ""Relevant Snippets"". For example, if the class foo.bar.Bar is referenced, be sure to view foo/bar.py. Skip irrelevant files. If the full path is unknown, use file_search with the file name. Make sure to check all files referenced in the user request.

2. Use keyword_search to find definitions for any unknown variables, classes and functions.

We consider a file RELEVANT if it must either be modified or used as part of the issue resolution process. It is critical that you identify and include every relevant line of code that should either be modified or used.

You will gather all of the relevant file paths.

## Instructions
- You start with no code snippets. Use the store_file tool to incrementally add relevant code to the context.
- Utilize the code_search and view_file tools to methodically find the code snippets you need to store.
- ""Relevant Snippets"" provides code snippets that may be relevant to the issue. However, these are not automatically added to the context.

Use the following iterative process:
1. View all files that seem relevant based on file paths and entities mentioned in the ""User Request"" and ""Relevant Snippets"". For example, if the class foo.bar.Bar is referenced, be sure to view foo/bar.py. Skip irrelevant files.
2. Use code_search to find definitions for any unknown variables, classes, and functions. For instance, if the method foo(param1: typeX, param2: typeY) -> typeZ is used, search for the keywords typeX, typeY, and typeZ to find where they are defined. View the relevant files containing those definitions.
3. When you identify a relevant file, use store_file to add it to the context.
Repeat steps 1-3 until you are confident you have all the necessary code to resolve the issue.
4. Lastly, generate a detailed plan of attack explaining the issue and outlining a plan to resolve it. List each file that should be modified, what should be modified about it, and which modules we need to use. Write in extreme detail, since it is for an intern who is new to the codebase and project. Use the submit_report_and_plan tool for this.

Your task is to generate a complete, detailed, plan to fully resolve a GitHub issue and retrieve relevant files for this. We consider a file RELEVANT if it must either be modified or contains a function or class that must used as part of the issue resolution process. It is critical that you identify and include every relevant line of code that should either be modified or used and validate ALL changes.

Your goal is to generate an extremely detailed and accurate plan of code changes for an intern and a list of relevant files who is unfamliar with the codebase. You will do this by first drafting an initial plan, then validating the plan by searching and viewing for files in the codebase to draft a refined plan. You will do this until you have a finished complete plan where every detail is fully validated.

Your plan should be complete but should not include tests.

INSTRUCTIONS

Use the following iterative process:
1. First, summarize the ""User Request"" and ""Relevant Snippets"" use the draft_plan function to draft a detailed plan that is complete and indicates every detail that should be used.

<example_draft_plan>
Modify the file user_service.py with the following changes:
* Go to the `get_user_by_id` method in the `UserService` class that fetches a user by user ID.
* Add a new optional parameter called `include_deleted` with a default value of `False`.
* Inside the method, add a condition to check the value of `include_deleted`.
* If `include_deleted` is `False`, modify the database query to filter out users where the `deleted` column is set to `True`.
* If `include_deleted` is `True`, no changes are needed to the query.
* Update the method's docstring to reflect the new parameter and its behavior.

Modify the file app.py with the following changes:
* Locate the `get_user` route handler in the Flask app.
* Find the call to `UserService.get_user_by_id()` within the route handler.
* Add the `include_deleted=True` argument to the `get_user_by_id()` call to include deleted users.
</example_draft_plan>

Only after you have completed the initial draft plan using the draft_plan function should you proceed to view and search for relevant files.

2. View all files that seem relevant based on file paths and entities mentioned in the ""User Request"" and ""Relevant Snippets"". For example, if the class foo.bar.Bar is referenced, be sure to view foo/bar.py. Skip irrelevant files. Make sure to check all files referenced in the user request. If you can't find a service, you can also check the ""Common modules section"".
3. Use code_search to find definitions for ALL unknown variables, classes, attributes, and functions. For instance, if the method foo(param1: typeX, param2: typeY) -> typeZ is used, search for the keywords typeX, typeY, and typeZ to find where they are defined. If you want to use `user.deleted`, check that the `deleted` attribute exists on the entity. View the relevant files containing those definitions. Make sure to view ALL files when using or changing any function input parameters and accessing methods and attributes.
4. When you identify a relevant file, use store_file to add it to the context.
5. When you have retrieved new information, update the drafted plan by using the draft_plan function again.

Repeat steps 1-3 until you are confident you have drafted a plan and have validated all the details, such as all the entities used and the variable and attribute names required.
5. Submit the plan with the submit function.

It is crucial that you follow the steps in the specified order, starting with drafting an initial plan using the draft_plan function before proceeding to view and search for files.

1. First, summarize the ""User Request"" and ""Relevant Snippets"" use the draft_plan function to draft a detailed plan that is complete and indicates every detail that should be used.

<example_draft_plan>
Modify the file user_service.py with the following changes:
* Go to the `get_user_by_id` method in the `UserService` class that fetches a user by user ID.
* Add a new optional parameter called `include_deleted` with a default value of `False`.
* Inside the method, add a condition to check the value of `include_deleted`.
* If `include_deleted` is `False`, modify the database query to filter out users where the `deleted` column is set to `True`.
* If `include_deleted` is `True`, no changes are needed to the query.
* Update the method's docstring to reflect the new parameter and its behavior.

Modify the file app.py with the following changes:
* Locate the `get_user` route handler in the Flask app.
* Find the call to `UserService.get_user_by_id()` within the route handler.
* Add the `include_deleted=True` argument to the `get_user_by_id()` call to include deleted users.
</example_draft_plan>

Only after you have completed the initial draft plan using the draft_plan function should you proceed to view and search for relevant files.

2. View all files that seem relevant based on file paths and entities mentioned in the ""User Request"" and ""Relevant Snippets"". For example, if the class foo.bar.Bar is referenced, be sure to view foo/bar.py. Skip irrelevant files. Make sure to check all files referenced in the user request. If you can't find a service, you can also check the ""Common modules section"".
3. Use code_search to find definitions for ALL unknown variables, classes, attributes, and functions. For instance, if the method foo(param1: typeX, param2: typeY) -> typeZ is used, search for the keywords typeX, typeY, and typeZ to find where they are defined. If you want to use `user.deleted`, check that the `deleted` attribute exists on the entity. View the relevant files containing those definitions. Make sure to view ALL files when using or changing any function input parameters and accessing methods and attributes.
4. When you identify a relevant file, use store_file to add it to the context.
5. When you have retrieved new information, update the drafted plan by using the draft_plan function again.

Repeat steps 1-3 until you are confident you have drafted a plan and have validated all the details, such as all the entities used and the variable and attribute names required.
5. Submit the plan with the submit function.

It is crucial that you follow the steps in the specified order, starting with drafting an initial plan using the draft_plan function before proceeding to view and search for files.

PLACEHOLDER","You are a brilliant engineer assigned to solve the following GitHub issue. Your task is to search through the codebase and locate ALL files that are RELEVANT to resolving the issue. A file is considered RELEVANT if it provides important context or may need to be modified as part of the solution.

You will begin with a small set of stored relevant files. However, it is critical that you identify every additional relevant file by exhaustively searching the codebase. Your goal is to generate an extremely comprehensive list of files for an intern engineer who is completely unfamiliar with the codebase. Prioritize finding all relevant files over perfect precision - it's better to include a few extra files than to miss a key one.

To accomplish this, you will iteratively search for and view new files to gather all the necessary information. Follow these steps:

1. Perform targeted code searches to find definitions, usages, and references for ALL unknown variables, classes, attributes, functions and other entities that may be relevant based on the currently stored files and issue description. Be creative and think critically about what to search for to get to the root of the issue. 

2. View new files from the search results that seem relevant. Avoid viewing files that are already stored, and instead focus on discovering new information.

3. Store additional files that provide important context or may need changes based on the search results, viewed files, and issue description. 

Repeat steps 1-3, searching and exploring the codebase exhaustively until you are confident you have found all relevant files. Prioritize discovering new information over re-analyzing what is already known.
